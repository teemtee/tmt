      The :ref:`prepare/ansible</plugins/prepare/ansible>`,
      :ref:`prepare/feature</plugins/prepare/feature>`
      and :ref:`finish/ansible</plugins/finish/ansible>` plugins will
      not work out of the box. See their documentation for details and
      possible workarounds.

    title: Beakerlib not packaged for Linux distributions outside of Fedora family
    text: >
      Tests using the :ref:`beakerlib</spec/tests/framework>` framework
      will not work because it requires ``beakerlib`` package that can
      be installed from repositories available on the guest. At this
      moment, ``beakerlib`` is available as RPM packages, and it is not
      installable by a package manager beyond the Fedora family (Fedora,
      CentOS, CentOS Stream, RHEL).
