    The retry session configuration has been improved to better handle
    transient HTTP errors such as ``503`` responses from services like
    ReportPortal. Default retries increased from ``3`` to ``10``
    and backoff factor from ``0.1`` to ``1``. New environment variables
    ``TMT_RETRY_SESSION_RETRIES`` and ``TMT_RETRY_SESSION_BACKOFF_FACTOR``
    allow users to override these defaults.
