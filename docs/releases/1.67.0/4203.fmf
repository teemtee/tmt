    The :ref:`/plugins/provision/virtual.testcloud` provision plugin
    now supports the :tmt:story:`boot.method</spec/hardware/boot>` hardware
    constraint, allowing users to explicitly select BIOS or UEFI boot
    method for their x86_64 guests. For other architectures, the boot
    method is set automatically and cannot be changed.
