  Introduced option ``--import-before-name-filter`` and equivalent
  environment variable ``TMT_IMPORT_BEFORE_NAME_FILTER`` which imports
  all remote plans before applying filters such as in
  ``tmt plans ls <name>``. This is **required** for the filtering to
  properly work with ``importing: become-parent`` option.
