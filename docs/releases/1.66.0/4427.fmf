  Beakerlib libraries can now be referenced without a ``url`` or ``path`` key.
  In that case the ``name`` is relative to the discovered test's tmt tree.
  The ``nick`` key **must** be set in this situation, matching what the
  consuming scripts are using in ``rlImport``, or the name of the repo or
  equivalent.
