    Added ``adjust-plans`` support for :ref:`/spec/plans/import`, enabling flexible step
    inheritance and modification of imported plans using the same powerful
    rule system as :ref:`/spec/core/adjust` and :ref:`/plugins/discover/fmf`.
    This allows selective modification and addition of steps when importing remote plans.
