  The :ref:`/plugins/discover/shell` discover plugin now supports
  the ``path`` and ``url-content-type`` keys, which are handled
  in the same way as in the :ref:`/plugins/discover/fmf` discover
  plugin. The plugin now also correctly installs test dependencies
  specified in the ``require`` and ``recommend`` keys.
