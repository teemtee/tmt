  The :ref:`/plugins/discover/shell` discover plugin now supports
  the ``url-content-type`` key, which is handled in the same way
  as in the :ref:`/plugins/discover/fmf` discover plugin.
  The plugin now also correctly installs test dependencies
  specified in the ``require`` and ``recommend`` keys.
