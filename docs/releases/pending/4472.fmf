  tmt now correctly applies :ref:`plugin-variables` even when
  plugin is not mentioned on the command line. This has been a limit
  imposed by tmt implementation, where only phases of plugins explicitly
  mentioned were modified by environment. For example, ``tmt run report
  -h html`` would ignore every ``TMT_PLUGIN_REPORT_*`` environment
  variable except those for the ``html`` plugin, ``TMT_PLUGIN_REPORT_HTML_*``.
  This limitation has been removed.
