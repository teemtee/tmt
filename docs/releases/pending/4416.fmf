  Test :ref:`/spec/tests/duration` is now measured and enforced across
  all test restarts and guest reboots. With previous tmt versions,
  a guest reboot or test restart cleared the duration timer, and every
  test invocation was therefore given full budget. This could lead to
  tests running forever. From this release, tmt measures the duration
  for the test as a whole, no matter how many times it was invoked.
