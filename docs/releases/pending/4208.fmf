  tmt can now load recipes using the ``tmt run --recipe`` command.
  Currently, only discover phases and tests are supported, and they
  will override any existing discover phases in the plan. For this
  to work, the current run must already include a plan with the same
  name as the one defined in the recipe, which tmt will update
  by replacing its discover phases. Note that recipe loading is still
  experimental and may change in future releases.
