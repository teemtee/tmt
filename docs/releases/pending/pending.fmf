    Failing git clone operations will not be retried if it previously failed
    for the same url.

/beakerlib:
  description: |
    Beakerlib library dependencies are now allowed to have colliding
    repositories as long as the ``name`` differs. If both the ``repo`` and
    ``name`` part collide, the earlier definition is preferred and will be used
    in the test.
