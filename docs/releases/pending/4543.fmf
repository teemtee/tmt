    Added documentation warning that ``TMT_TREE`` should not be used
    for storing persistent data between steps. The :ref:`step-variables`
    section now clearly guides users to use ``TMT_PLAN_DATA`` for data
    that needs to persist across steps, and ``TMT_TEST_DATA`` for
    test-specific artifacts.
