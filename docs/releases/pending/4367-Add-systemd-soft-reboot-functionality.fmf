  Systemd `soft-reboot`__, a userspace-only reboot which does not reset
  kernel state, is now supported by tmt when supported by the
  guest: systemd must be in control, and boot ID must be available.
  tmt would use the ``systemctl soft-reboot`` command to trigger the
  reboot. Both ``tmt-reboot`` script and ``reboot`` phase support it,
  via ``tmt-reboot -s`` command and ``systemd-soft`` key, respectively.
