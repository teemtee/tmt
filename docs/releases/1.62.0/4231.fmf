  Introduced option ``--import-before-filter`` and equivalent environment
  variable ``TMT_IMPORT_BEFORE_FILTER`` which imports all remote plans
  before applying filters such as in ``tmt plans ls <name>``. This is
  **required** for the filtering to properly work with
  ``importing: become-parent`` option.
