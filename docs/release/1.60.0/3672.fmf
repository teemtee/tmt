description:
    tmt now supports automatic generation of Ansible inventory
    files during the provision phase. The new
    :ref:`/spec/plans/ansible` configuration allows users to
    define custom inventory layouts and organize provisioned
    guests into Ansible groups with host-specific variables. See
    the :ref:`/spec/plans/ansible` and
    :ref:`/spec/plans/provision/ansible` sections for
    configuration details.
