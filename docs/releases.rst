tmt-1.28
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new :ref:`/stories/cli/multiple phases/update-missing` option
can be used to update step phase fields only when not set in the
``fmf`` files. In this way it's possible to easily fill the gaps
in the plans, for example provide the default distro image.

The :ref:`/spec/plans/report/html` report plugin now shows
provided :ref:`/spec/plans/context` and link to the test ``data``
directory so that additional logs can be easily checked.

The **avc** :ref:`/spec/tests/check` allows to detect avc denials
which appear during the test execution.

A new ``skip`` custom result outcome has been added to the
:ref:`/spec/plans/results` specification.

All context :ref:`/spec/context/dimension` values are now handled
in a case insensitive way.

See the `full changelog`__ for more details.
