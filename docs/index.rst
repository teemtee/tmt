Welcome to the Test Management Tool documentation!

The **tmt** python module and command line tool implement the
:ref:`specification` which allows to store all test metadata
directly within a git repository. It provides an elegant and
comfortable way to manage tests and safely execute them across
different environments.

Check the :ref:`Overview<overview>` to get a high-level summary of
available functionality, follow our :ref:`guide` which will help
you with the first steps and teach you how to efficiently use the
tool, check out the :ref:`stories` which motivated the effort,
consult the :ref:`specification` to get detailed information about
supported features, get inspired by many :ref:`examples`
demonstrating the usage on real-life scenarios.
