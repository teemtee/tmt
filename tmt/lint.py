Metadata linting.

Internal APIs, classes, shared functionality and helpers for test, plan and
story metadata linting.

A mixin class, :py:class:`Lintable`, provides the required functionality for
base classes. Namely, it takes care of linter discovery and provides
:py:meth:`Lintable.lint` method to run them.

Classes spiced with ``Lintable`` define their sets of linters. Consider the
following examples:

.. code-block:: python

   # Methods whose names start with ``lint_*`` prefix are considered *linters*,
   # and linters perform one or more *checks* users can enable or disable.
   def lint_path_exists(self) -> LinterReturn:
       # A linter must have a docstring which is then used to generate documentation,
       # e.g. when ``lint --list-checks`` is called. The docstring must begin with
       # a linter *id*. The id should match ``[CTPS]\\d\\d\\d`` regular expression:
       # ``C``ommon, ``T``est, ``P``lan, ``S``tory, plus a three-digit serial number
       # of the check among its peers.
       ''' T004: test directory path must exist '''

       # Linter implements a generator (see :py:member:`LinterReturn`) yielding
       # two item tuples of :py:class:`LinterOutcome` and string messages.

       if not self.path:
           yield LinterOutcome.FAIL, 'directory path is not set'
           return

       test_path = os.path.join(self.node.root, os.path.relpath(self.path.strip(), '/'))

       if not os.path.exists(test_path):
           yield LinterOutcome.FAIL, f'test path "{test_path}" does not exist'
           return

       yield LinterOutcome.PASS, f'test path "{test_path}" does exist'

   def lint_manual_valid_markdown(self) -> LinterReturn:
       ''' T008: manual test should be valid markdown '''

       # Linter should yield `SKIP` outcome when it does not apply, to announce
       # it did inspect the object but realized the object is out of scope of
       # the linter, and checks do not apply.
       if not self.manual:
            yield LinterOutcome.SKIP, 'not a manual test'
            return

       manual_test = os.path.join(self.node.root, self.path.strip())

       warnings = tmt.export.check_md_file_respects_spec(manual_test)

       if warnings:
           # Linter may yield as many tuples as it deems necessary. This allows
           # for linters iterating over more granular aspects of metadata,
           # providing more specific hints.
           for warning in warnings:
              yield LinterOutcome.WARN, warning
