class ExecuteUpgrade(ExecuteInternal):
    """
    Perform system upgrade during testing.

    The upgrade executor runs the discovered tests (using the internal
    executor), then performs a set of upgrade tasks from a remote
    repository, and finally, re-runs the tests on the upgraded guest.

    The IN_PLACE_UPGRADE environment variable is set during the test
    execution to differentiate between the stages of the test. It is set
    to "old" during the first execution and "new" during the second
    execution. Test names are prefixed with this value to make the names
    unique.

    The upgrade tasks performing the actual system upgrade are taken
    from a remote repository either based on an upgrade path
    (e.g. fedora35to36) or filters. The upgrade path must correspond to
    a plan name in the remote repository whose discover step selects
    tests (upgrade tasks) performing the upgrade. Currently, selection
    of upgrade tasks in the remote repository can be done using both fmf
    and shell discover method. The supported keys in discover are:

      - ref
      - filter
      - exclude
      - tests
      - test

    The environment variables defined in the remote upgrade path plan are
    passed to the upgrade tasks when they are executed. An example of an
    upgrade path plan (in the remote repository):

        discover: # Selects appropriate upgrade tasks (L1 tests)
            how: fmf
            filter: "tag:fedora"
        environment: # This is passed to upgrade tasks
            SOURCE: 35
            TARGET: 36
        execute:
            how: tmt

    If no upgrade path is specified in the plan, the tests (upgrade tasks)
    are selected based on the configuration of the upgrade plugin
    (e.g. based on the filter in its configuration).

    If these two possible ways of specifying upgrade tasks are combined,
    the remote discover plan is used but its options are overridden
    with the values specified locally.

    The same options and config keys and values can be used as in the
    internal executor.

    Minimal execute config example with an upgrade path:

        execute:
            how: upgrade
            url: https://github.com/teemtee/upgrade
            upgrade-path: /paths/fedora35to36

    Execute config example without an upgrade path:

        execute:
            how: upgrade
            url: https://github.com/teemtee/upgrade
            filter: "tag:fedora"
