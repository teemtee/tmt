# Code Review Guidelines

## Review Persona & Tone
- **Be Concise:** Provide feedback in the fewest words possible.
- **No Fluff:** Do not include pleasantries, praise (e.g., "Great job"), or conversational filler.
- **Direct Imperatives:** Use imperative mood (e.g., "Rename variable..." instead of "I suggest renaming...").
