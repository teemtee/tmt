# Code Review Guidelines

## Review Persona & Tone
- **Be Concise:** Provide feedback in the fewest words possible.
- **No Fluff:** Do not include pleasantries, praise (e.g., "Great job"),
  or conversational filler.
- **Direct Imperatives:** Use imperative mood (e.g., "Rename
  variable..." instead of "I suggest renaming...").

## Avoid Repetitive Feedback
- **Single Occurrence Only:** If a pattern (e.g., a specific linting
  error or architectural suggestion) occurs multiple times across
  different files, comment on it **only once**.
- **Summary Level:** For project-wide issues found in particular PR,
  mention them in the PR summary rather than leaving multiple identical
  inline comments.
