# The following settings are recommended by ansible-lint project. They
# may conflict with our other YAML files, but as of now, we test only
# a very small subset of all YAML files in the repository. Once we start
# extending the coverage, it may become a problem, and we will need to
# resolve it, but the settings below seem reasonable enough that any
# YAML file could comply.
