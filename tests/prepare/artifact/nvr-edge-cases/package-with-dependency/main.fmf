summary: Test file artifact provider with NVR edge cases when dependencies are present in shared repository
description: |
    Test NVR edge cases when the shared repository contains both the
    requested packages and all their dependencies. Packages (jq, nano)
    are downloaded with --resolve --alldeps so the shared repo can
    satisfy all dependency requirements without falling back to system repos.
