summary: Test file artifact provider with NVR edge cases when dependencies are not present in shared repository
description: |
    Test NVR edge cases when the shared repository contains only the
    requested packages without their dependencies. Packages (jq, nano)
    are downloaded without --resolve --alldeps so the system must
    resolve dependencies from standard repositories.
