summary: TC 1.1 - Repository priority overrides package version
description: |
    Verify that DNF5 installs a package from a higher-priority repository
    even when a lower-priority repository offers a newer version.

    Repos used:
      - test-high-priority repo (priority=30) provides dummy-nvr-test-1.0
      - test-low-priority repo  (priority=50) provides dummy-nvr-test-2.0

    Expected result: dummy-nvr-test-1.0 is installed because the lower
    numeric priority value (30) overrides the higher package version.

test: ./tc11.sh
require:
  - dummy-nvr-test
