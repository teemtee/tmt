summary: TC 1.2 - Same priority falls back to NVR comparison
description: |
    Verify that when repositories share the same priority, DNF5 selects
    the package with the highest NVR (Name-Version-Release).

    Setup (done by the outer test.sh):
      - test-same-priority-a repo (priority=50) provides dummy-nvr-test-1.0
      - test-same-priority-b repo (priority=50) provides dummy-nvr-test-2.0

    Expected result: dummy-nvr-test-2.0 is installed because both repos
    have equal priority and DNF5 falls back to RPM version comparison.

test: ./tc12.sh
require:
  - dummy-nvr-test
