summary: Test DNF5 NVR resolution with repository priorities
description: |
    Verify DNF5 package resolution behavior when multiple repositories
    provide the same package with different versions and priorities.

    TC 1.1 - Priority overrides Version:
        A high-priority (priority=1) repository with an older package
        wins over a low-priority (priority=100) repository with a newer
        package.

    TC 1.2 - Same Priority favors NVR:
        When repository priorities are equal, DNF5 falls back to
        standard RPM version comparison and installs the highest NVR.

require:
  - tmt
  - createrepo_c
  - rpm-build

tag+:
  - provision-only
  - provision-container

adjust:
  - when: distro != fedora
    enabled: false
    because: Test relies on DNF5 behavior and uses Fedora containers
