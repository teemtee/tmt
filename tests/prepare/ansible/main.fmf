summary: Check that ansible prepare works for basic images
description:
    Try to provision a container with specific image (fedora,
    centos) and prepare it with an ansible playbook. Make sure the
    environment variables are correctly handed over. In the full
    testing mode check virtual and local provision method as well.

# By default we run under a container only
environment:
    PROVISION_METHODS: container
adjust+:
  - when: trigger == commit
    environment:
        PROVISION_METHODS: container local
    because: the pipeline does not support nested virtualization
