        Test BeakerAPI thread safety through selective mocking.

        NOTE: This test uses selective mocking due to the complexity of BeakerAPI's
        async initialization. While it doesn't test the full guest.start()/guest.setup()
        flow, it does test the critical thread-safe components:
        - Config file loading across threads
        - File system operations thread safety
        - BeakerAPI creation and setup
        - Import mechanism thread safety

        The real provisioning flow (guest.start() -> BeakerAPI initialization)
        proved too complex to test realistically due to async operations and
        external service dependencies.
