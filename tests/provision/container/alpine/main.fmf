summary: Test Alpine Linux container
description:
    Make sure that Alpine Linux container works as expected.
    The vanilla alpine linux does not contain `bash` package,
    so make sure a reasonable error is returned to the user.
    Run a simple successful check against the Alpine Linux
    tests image.
