summary: Test container provisioner in toolbox
description:
    Verify that container provisioner works well when tmt is run from
    a toolbox container and podman is run on the host system using
    `flatpak-spawn --host`. This is a common setup used in Fedora
    Silverblue.

require:
    - toolbox
tag+:
  - provision-only
  - provision-container
require+:
  - toolbox
adjust+:
  - enabled: false
    when: distro != fedora
    because: Setting up toolbox on CS9 with default UBI9 toolbox image is a pain.
  - check:
      - how: avc
        result: xfail
    when: distro >= fedora-41
    because: |
      We are not interested in AVCs for this test due to complicated setup.
