summary: Verify `tmt+provision-virtual` package dependencies
description:
    Check that `tmt+provision-virtual` package brings with itself
    all necessary dependencies needed for both `session` and
    `system` connection to work without additional steps except
    for setting group and starting the `libvirtd` service for the
    `system` case.

# In order to properly verify that all packages necessary for the
# virtual provision are installed on the guest, this test would
# have to be a single one in the plan. Probably not worth it.
# Disabling for now to prevent wasting resources.
