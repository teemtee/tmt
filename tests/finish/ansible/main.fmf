summary: Check that ansible finish works for basic images
description:
    Try to provision a container with specific image (fedora,
    centos) and finish it with an ansible playbook. Make sure the
    environment variables are correctly handed over and logs are
    pulled back. In the full testing mode check virtual and local
    provision method as well.

# By default we run under a container only
environment:
    PROVISION_METHODS: container
adjust:
  - when: trigger == commit
    environment:
        PROVISION_METHODS: container local
    because: the pipeline does not support nested virtualization
  - when: how == full
    environment:
        PROVISION_METHODS: container virtual local
    because: local/virtual provision needs root/full virtualization
