summary: Check whether worktree is correctly set
description:
    For the `prepare` and `finish` steps, the current working
    directory must be set to the metadata tree root for best user
    experience. By default tested in a `container, for pull
    requests also against `local` and during `full` testing using
    `virtual` as well.

environment:
    METHODS: 'container'
adjust:
  - environment:
        METHODS: 'container local'
    when: trigger == commit
  - environment:
        METHODS: 'container local virtual'
