summary: Integration tests with requre support
description: |
    This part of the testsuite uses project requre. It stores
    communication with nitrate server to local `test_data`
    directory where tests are defined.

    Regeneration

    If you want to regenerate some file for test, just remove
    existing response file and run it on your machine with your
    credentials::

        rm -rf tests/integration/test_data/*
        cd tests/integration
        pytest -v

    Remove sensitive data

    If there are any sensitive data you can use the requre-patch
    tool from requre project to remove timestamps, sensitive urls,
    tokens or passwords. The syntax is as follows::

        key_identifiers:key_in_response:python_type:replaced_value

    Example::

        requre-patch purge --replaces :milestone_url:str:SomeText \
            tests/integration/test_data/test_nitrate/*

    Debugging

    To see if there is no network communication, just use e.g. the
    `unshare` command::

        cd tests/integration
        sudo unshare -n sudo -u `whoami` pytest -v test_nitrate.py
