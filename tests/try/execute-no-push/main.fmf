summary: Test that execute action preserves manual changes made during login
description: |
    Verifies that the 'execute' action in tmt try doesn't overwrite
    manual changes made to test files on the guest. This addresses
    GitHub issue #4046 where the execute action would rediscover
    and push files from host, overwriting guest modifications.

    The test includes comprehensive verification of all interactive actions:
    - test (t): Should always push fresh code from host
    - execute (e): Should preserve manual guest modifications
