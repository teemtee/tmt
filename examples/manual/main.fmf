  Example demonstrates using MarkDown with defined structure to
  describe manual test actions necessary for its execution.

  services. Note that any sections may contain shell script
  code which could be used for semi-automated execution in the
  future.
manual: true
/mini:
  summary: Minimal manual test
  test: mini.md

/full:
