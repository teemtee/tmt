    As a user I want to add, remove and adjust one or more step phases via command
    line.
    I should be able to add new phases, without overwriting those loaded from fmf,
    adjust existing phases and their keys, and remove any of the existing phases.
    I should be able to adjust or remove either all phases or just a single phase
    by its name.
    I should be able to change even ``how`` key of phases, i.e. change the plugin
    of phases.
    I should be able to adjust or remove phases no matter what their source was,
    both phases loaded from fmf or added via CLI should be affected in the same
    way.

/add:
    summary: Allow adding new phases via command line

    example:
      - |
        # Use --insert to add a phase without overwriting phases loaded from fmf.
        # Both default `display`` and newly added `html` would run.
        tmt run -a report --insert html

      - |
        # Add an extra report phase to create a junit report, make it run as soon as possible
        tmt run -a report --insert --how html --order 1

/update:
    summary: Allow adjusting multiple phases via command line

    example:
      - |
        # Set the default report phase to be a HTML report
        tmt run -a report --how html

      - |
        # When specified multiple times, only the last phase mentioned would be honored.
        # In this case, only a `junit` report would run.
        tmt run -a report --how html report --how junit

      - |
        # Use --update to adjust a particular phase only
        tmt run -a report --update --name dummy-html-report --how html --display-guest never

      - |
        # Use --update without --name to adjust all phases. All phases would turn into
        # `html` and would not display guest names in their output.
        tmt run -a report --update --how html --display-guest never

/remove:
    summary: Allow removing phases via command line

    example:
      - |
        # Use --remove to drop an existing phase
        tmt run -a report --remove --name dummy-html-report

      - |

        tmt run -a report --remove
