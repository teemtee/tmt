/default:
    story: 'Default should cover the most common use case'
    description:
        Run all relevant tests on the default environment.
        Default environment should be something safe which
        should not modify user environment. Perhaps something
        like 'x86_64 virtual machine from the testing farm'?
    example: tmt run

/interactive:
    story: 'Provide way similar to git rebase --interactive'
    description:
        Provide users with list of steps and let them edit them.
        Allow adding commands between, or at least interactive "pause".
        When user would be finished with single step, just continue recipe.
        Do not force users to remember all steps when working with them.
        Make it possible to repeat single step or abort current run.
        Allow repeating some steps just by repeating lines with task.
    example:
        - tmt run --all --interactive
        - tmt run --continue
        - tmt run --abort

/upgrade:
    story:
        As a tester I want to verify that a configured application
        or service still correctly works after the system upgrade.
    description: |
        In order to enable developing tests for upgrade testing we
        need to provide a way how to execute these tests easily.
        This does not cover unit tests for individual actors but
        rather system tests which verify the whole upgrade story.

        The plan is to provide an environment variable available
        to the test denoting current phase of the upgrade testing
        (``before`` or ``after`` the upgrade). Based on this
        variable test can perform appropriate actions.

        before
            setup, test
        after
            test, cleanup
        without
            setup, test, cleanup

        Combining test step selection feature and defining extra
        environment variables together with an external framework
        to perform the actual system upgrade should give us a nice
        way how to achieve the desired functionality. In addition,
        we will also need to implement a way how to aggregate test
        results from both runs (before and after the upgrade).
    example:
        - tmt run --id foo discover provision --image=rhel7 --output=box.json
        - tmt run --id foo execute --environment='UPGRADE=before'
        - upgrade-the-system box.json
        - tmt run --id foo execute --environment='UPGRADE=after'
        - tmt run --id foo report finish
