story:
    As a tester I want the option to execute tests using the
    ``restraint`` harness.

description: |
    Restraint is the default harness in beaker for RHEL8 and
    beyond. In order to provide compatibility with beaker
    style tests, I would like a way to invoke ``tmt`` using
    the Restaint harness. This would enable Restraint tests to
    be invoked by ``tmt`` without modification. Some common
    commands include ``rstrnt-reboot``, ``rstrnt-abort``, and
    ``rstrnt-report-result``.

    Although implementation of the full execute step plugin has
    been deferred, backward compatibility scripts have been
    provided for several most commonly used restraint commands.
    See the :ref:`restraint-compatibility` section for details.

example:
  - tmt run --all execute --how restraint
