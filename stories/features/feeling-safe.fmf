title: Unsafe scripts executed on tmt runner

story: |
    As testers or tmt developers, we would like to run user-defined
    scripts on the tmt runner.

description: |
    There have been several cases where custom scripts could extend
    tmt functionality or provide an unknown information. Unfortunately,
    such scripts would often need to run on the tmt runner. For example:

    * an external script might be called to provide a list of
      discovered tests,
    * a custom scripts might be used to trigger a guest reboot.

    These scripts would be specified as any other input, i.e. via
    metadata keys or command line options. Being outside of control
    of tmt developers, scripts may contain possibly dangerous code,
    or have unexpected side effects. Yet, in some situations, system
    or person managing a tmt run might have full control over these
    scripts, and therefore they would be able to make sure they are
    correct and safe. It would be beneficial to allow informed use
    of these scripts.

    ``tmt`` command gains a new option, ``--feeling-safe``. When
    specified, tmt will allow and obey possibly unsafe metadata keys
    and command line options. When not specified, keys and options
    deemed unsafe would lead to an error.
