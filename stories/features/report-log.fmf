title: Save a log file
story: >
  As a tester I want to save a log from a test using the
  restraint command during test execution.

description: |
  The ``tmt-file-submit`` command can be used to save a log
  file specified during test execution. This command together
  with ``rstrnt-report-log``, ``rhts-submit-log`` and
  ``rhts_submit_log`` provides a backward-compatible way to
  execute tests written for the `restraint`__ framework.
  These scripts are installed on the guest and overwrite
  any existing scripts with the same name.

  The command can be called multiple times for a single test,
  if a log of that name already exists then it will be
  overwritten.

  tmt-file-submit -l /path/to/log/log.txt
