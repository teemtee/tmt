title: Abort test execution
story: >
  As a tester I want to abort current, and all subsequent,
  test executions using a shell command during test
  execution.

description: |
  The ``tmt-abort`` command can be used to abort the current
  test execution. This command together with the
  ``rstrnt-abort`` and ``rhts-abort`` aliases provides a
  backward-compatible way to execute tests written for the
  `restraint`__ framework. These scripts are installed on the
  guest and overwrite any existing scripts with the same name.

  tmt-abort
