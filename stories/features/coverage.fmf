title: Test Coverage
story:
    As a tester I want to document the test coverage, so that it
    can be easily tracked which user stories are covered by which
    test case and vice-versa.

/relevancy:
    summary:
        Story relevancy
    story:
        As a product owner I want to connect user stories with
        products or versions, so that I can filter out items
        relevant (or not relevant) for a particular product.
    description:
        Relevancy is an easy way to bind stories to particular
        product(s). The same relevancy rules as for tests should
        be also used for stories.
    example: |
        story:
            As an admin I want product A doing B, so that I can
            use it for C.
        adjust:
          - enabled: False
            when: distro < fedora-28
    priority: should

/reference:
    summary:
        Referencing remote repositories
    story:
        As a tester I want to reference not only local objects,
        so that user stories can be covered by test cases from a
        different repository.
    description:
        It is possible to use a full fmf identifier in the
        :ref:`/spec/core/link` attribute.
    example: |
        verified-by:
            url: https://github.com/psss/fmf
            ref: master
            name: /tests/basic/repo

            Filtering based on fmf identifiers
        story:
            As a tester I want to filter based on reference
            identifiers, so that I can learn where the tests are
            implemented/maintained.
        description:
            There should be an easy way to filter based on fmf
            identifiers.
        example: |
            tmt story ls --filter "url:https://gitlab/project"
            tmt story ls --filter "url:https://gitlab/project & ref:master name:/tests/smoke"
        priority: should

    /tags:
        summary: Filtering based on test tags
        story:
            As a tester I want to filter user stories based on the
            referenced tests tags, so that I can see what coverage
            the stories have.
        description:
            There should be an easy way to filter based on tests
            tags.
        example: |
            tmt story ls --filter "tag:fast"
        priority: should
