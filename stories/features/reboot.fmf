title: Reboot during test
story:
    As a tester I need to reboot the guest during a test and then
    resume the test execution.
description: |
    Some tests may require a reboot as a part of them, e.g.
    upgrading the system, rebooting and then running some checks.
    The ``tmt-reboot`` command can be used to request the guest
    reboot from the test and the ``TMT_REBOOT_COUNT`` environment
    variable provides number of successfully completed reboots.

    Note that this only works with guests provisioned by tmt, e.g.
    ``container`` or ``virtual``, and doesn't work with the the
    ``local`` provision method. Support of the ``connect``
    provision is on a best effort basis and will not work on
    machines where ``reboot`` command is not available.

    When a custom command for rebooting is required, the ``-c``
    option of the reboot script can be used, e.g. ``tmt-reboot -c
    "dnf system-upgrade reboot"``.

    For backward-compatibility reasons the ``rstrnt-reboot`` and
    ``rhts-reboot`` commands are provided as well together with
    the ``RSTRNT_REBOOTCOUNT`` and ``REBOOTCOUNT`` environment
    variables.

example: |
    if [ "$TMT_REBOOT_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
        rlRun "echo 'Before the reboot'"
        rlRun "tmt-reboot" 0 "Reboot the machine"
    elif [ "$TMT_REBOOT_COUNT" -eq 1 ]; then
        rlRun "echo 'After the reboot'"
    fi
