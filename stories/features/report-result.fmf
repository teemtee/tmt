title: Report test result
story:
    As a tester I want to report test results using the restraint
    command during test execution.

description: |
    The ``tmt-report-result`` command can be used to report result
    of the test during its execution. This command together with
    ``rstrnt-report-result`` and ``rhts-report-result`` provides a
    backward-compatible way to execute tests written for the
    `restraint`__ framework. These scripts are installed on the
    guest and overwrite any existing scripts with the same name.

    The command can be called multiple times for a single test,
    the final result will be the most severe rating. Available
    values ordered by severity are SKIP, PASS, WARN and FAIL.
    Note, that the only value currently processed by ``tmt`` is
    the test result, other options are silently ignored.

    When ``tmt-report-result`` is called, the return value of the
    test itself is ignored, and only result saved by
    ``tmt-report-result`` is consumed by tmt.
