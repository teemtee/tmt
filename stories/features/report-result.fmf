title: Report test result
story:
    As a tester I want to report test results using the restraint
    command during the test execution.

description: |
    The ``tmt-report-result`` command can be used to report result
    of the test during its execution. This command together with
    ``rstrnt-report-result`` and ``rhts-report-result`` provides a
    backward-compatible way to execute tests written for the
    `restraint`__ framework. These scripts are installed on the
    guest and overwrite any existing scripts with the same name.

    The command can be called multiple times for a single test,
    all these calls will be internally saved as tmt subresults.
    The final result will be the most severe rating. Available
    values ordered by severity are SKIP, PASS, WARN and FAIL.

    Once the ``tmt-report-result`` command is called for the first
    time, the return value of the test itself no longer matters,
    and only the results saved by ``tmt-report-result`` command
    calls are consumed by tmt.
