    As a user migrating from old tools I want to quickly
    learn how to achieve my common daily tasks with the new
    tooling.
  description: >
    Provide a Quick Start Guide describing the most common
    scenarios and showing mapping of old command to the new
    syntax.

    - How do I do 'wow --reserve' with tmt?
    - How do I do 'make run' with tmt?
