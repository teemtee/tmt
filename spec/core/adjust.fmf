summary: Adjust metadata based on the given context

story:
    As a user I want to adjust test, plan or story metadata
    based on the given context such as product, distribution,
    architecture or trigger.

description: |
    The ``adjust`` attribute allows to modify arbitrary object
    metadata based on the context in which they are to be used.
    For example, tests may be relevant only for given environment,
    the set of required packages may differ across distributions
    or there might be a different set of plans executed for pull
    requests versus for the full compose integration testing.

    .. note::
        The context currently has to be specified explicitly, see
        the :ref:`/spec/context` documentation for details. In the
        future, **tmt** will detect (at least some of) the needed
        information from the environment.

    The value can be a dictionary or a list of dictionaries which
    represent individual rules to be applied. Each rule contains
    metadata to be merged into the original object. The following
    three keys are reserved for rule evaluation:

    when
        The condition to be evaluated in order to decide if the
        metadata should be merged. In the expression, you can use
        any defined context :ref:`/spec/context/dimension`. See
        the full `condition syntax`__ for details about supported
        operators. This is a **required** key.

    continue
        By default, all provided rules are evaluated. When set to
        ``false``, the first successful rule finishes the
        evaluation and the rest is ignored. Must be a ``boolean``.

    because
        An optional comment with justification of the adjustment.
        Must be a ``string``.

    .. note::
        This covers and extends the original concept of `Test Case
        Relevancy`__ which is now obsoleted.

example: |
    # Disable a test for older distros
    enabled: true
    adjust:
        enabled: false
        when: distro < fedora-33
        because: the feature was added in Fedora 33

    # Adjust the required package name
    require: procps-ng
    adjust:
      - require: procps
        when: distro == centos-6

    # Extend the environment variables, use multiple rules
    adjust:
      - environment+:
            SH: bash
        when: component == bash
        continue: true
      - when: distro < centos-6
        enabled: false

    # Install the fresh pytest from pip on older distros
    adjust:
        prepare+:
         - how: shell
           name: fresh-pytest
           order: 90
           script: 'python3 -m pip install -U pytest'
        when: distro < rhel-8
