summary: Allow disabling individual tests, plans or stories

story:
    As a developer or tester I want selected tests or plans to be
    skipped during test execution.

description: |
    When a test or a plan is broken or it is not relevant for
    given :ref:`/spec/context` it can be disabled so that it's
    skipped during the execution. For stories, this attribute
    might be used to mark stories which should be skipped when
    generating the documentation.

    Must be a ``boolean``. The default value is ``true``.

example: |
    # Mark as disabled
    enabled: false

    # Disable for older distros
    enabled: true
    adjust:
        enabled: false
        when: distro < fedora-33
        because: the feature was added in Fedora 33

    # List only enabled tests
    tmt tests ls --filter enabled:true
