    As a user, I want tmt to generate a recipe file that can be reused to reproduce
    a run with the exact same configuration, without requiring additional input.

description: |
    A recipe is a YAML file that captures a complete, static snapshot of a tmt
    run after all dynamic evaluation has been resolved. It includes preprocessed
    information about plans, tests, and run configuration, as well as links to the
    ``results.yaml`` files created in previous run. All environment variables included
    in the recipe are evaluated.

    Generated recipe can be edited, manually or by using a script, which allows users
    to select only a subset of discovered tests to be reexecuted.

    .. note::
        All git repositories specified in the recipe will be fetched again during the
        recipe execution.

    .. note::
        When submitting a new run based on a recipe, the ``results-path`` key of the
        ``execute`` step is ignored. New results will be generated from the actual
        test execution. Users can use this key to access the results created
        in previous run to modify the recipe and filter the tests that should
        be reexecuted.
