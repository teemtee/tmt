    As an owner of a CI system or product CI workflow, I would like to
    modify all component plans and tests to include phases and checks
    that are deemed mandatory for the given CI workflow.

    tmt policies offer a powerful and flexible way to dynamically
    modify test metadata using templates. Instead of maintaining multiple
    similar test versions, you can define a base test and then apply
    policy to adjust its properties for different scenarios (e.g.,
    different environments, feature flags, or CI runs).

    A policy is stored in a YAML file, and consists of one or more
    rules, each mapping a test key to a template that provides new
    content for the said key.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        test-policy:
          - <test key>: <template>
            <test key>: <template>
            ...

          - <test key>: <template>
            <test key>: <template>
            ...

    A policy is applied by tmt after metadata are finalized. It is
    applied on fully materialized tests, i.e. after reading fmf files,
    ``adjust`` evaluation, and after all command-line options were taken
    into account. All values would also be normalized, e.g. ``tag`` or
    ``contact`` keys would always be lists of strings, and so on. At
    this point, policies have access to the most final content of test
    keys.

    When a policy is applied:

    * the template string is rendered as a
      :ref:`jinja2 template <custom_templates>`.
    * the rendered output is treated as if it were
      :ref:`test metadata </spec/tests>` from an fmf file. Text is
      parsed and normalized as any other fmf input.
    * finally, it replaces the original value of the specified metadata
      key.

    .. important::

       New data **replaces** the original value of the key. If the
       original value needs to be reflected in the new value, it is the
       responsibility of the rule and its template to include it
       accordingly. There are no "magic" operators for addition or
       merging provided by the policy syntax, new value fully replaces
       the old one.

       .. code-block:: yaml

          test-policy:
            # The following will erase all checks tests may have defined,
            # and every test will gain just a single `dmesg` check instead:
            - check: |
                - how: dmesg

            # Use `VALUE` to propagate the original content:
            - check: |
                - how: dmesg

                {% for item in VALUE %}
                - {{ item }}
                {% endfor %}

    .. important::

       Since the task of the template is to produce valid fmf data, the
       indentation of its content is crucial:

       .. code-block:: yaml

          test-policy:
            - check: |
                - how: dmesg

                  # The following will not work because `check` is a list
                  # of checks, and therefore `VALUE` will contain a list
                  # which, if emitted into template this way, would produce
                  # invalid fmf (a list nested in a mapping).
                  {{ VALUE }}

    Within the templates, additional variables are defined:

    * ``VALUE``: the original value of the metadata key being modified.
    * ``VALUE_SOURCE``: source of the original value: ``fmf`` when the
      value was set by fmf data, ``cli`` when the value was set via
      command line, ``default`` when the value is the default value of
      the key, i.e. no other explicit value was set, and ``policy`` when
      the value was set by previous policy instruction.
    * ``TEST``: the entire test object, allowing you to access any of
      its metadata fields for conditional logic (e.g., ``TEST.contact``,
      ``TEST.component``).

example:
  - |
    # To unconditionally change a key value, provide the new value
    # directly - the template does not need to use any variables or
    # advanced constructs.

    test-policy:
      # Sets the test duration to 24 hours for all tests.
      - duration: 24h

  - |
    # Conditional modification: use flow controls (e.g., if/else) to
    # change values based on existing test metadata.

    test-policy:
      # Adds a specific command prefix only if the test is owned by
      # 'foo-sst@redhat.com'.
      - test: |
          {% if "foo-sst@redhat.com" in TEST.contact %}
          scl enable gcc-toolset-15 {{ VALUE }}
          {% else %}
          {{ VALUE }}
          {% endif %}

  - |
    # Add items only if they (or similar items) don't already exist:

    test-policy:
      # Adds a default 'avc' check only if no 'avc' check is already
      # defined. Preserves all original checks.
      - check: |
          {# If no 'avc' check has been defined, inject the default one. #}
          {% if 'avc' not in VALUE | map(attribute='how') %}
          - how: avc
            result: respect
          {% endif %}

          {# Make sure to include checks already picked by the test #}
          {% for item in VALUE %}
          - {{ item }}
          {% endfor %}
