summary: Test framework which should execute tests

description: |
    Execute discovered tests on provisioned boxes with optional
    support for parallelization.

    Examples of execution implementation:

    shell
        execute arbitratry shell commands, check exit code (default)
    beakerlib
        run beakerlib tests, check the journal for test results
    restraint
        use the restraint harness to execute beakerlib tests

    For each ``plan`` the execute step should produce a ``results.yaml`` file
    with the list of results for each test in the following format::

        /test/one:
            result: TEST_RESULT
            log: PATH

        /test/two:
            result: TEST_RESULT
            log: PATH

    Where ``TEST_RESULT`` is the outcome of the test. It can have these values:

        * info - test finished and produced only information message
        * passed - test finished and passed
        * failed - test finished and failed
        * error - a problem encountered during test execution, treated as failed

    Where ``PATH`` is the test log output path, relative to the execute step plan run directory.

example: |
    execute:
        how: beakerlib

/isolate:
    summary: Run tests in an isolated environment
    description:
        Optional boolean attribute `isolate` can be used to
        request a clean test environment for each test.
    example: |
        execute:
            how: beakerlib
            isolate: true

/shell:
    summary: Execute shell scripts

    /default:
        summary: Shell is the default executor
        description: |
            The `shell` implementation is the default one.  Thus
            you can omit the `how` keyword and just define the
            `script` to be run.  This is how a minimal smoke test
            for the `fmf` command line can look like:
        example: |
            execute:
                script: fmf --help

    /multi:
        summary: Multiple shell commands
        description:
            You can also include several commands as a list.
            Executor will run commands one-by-one and check exit
            code of each.
        example: |
            execute:
                script:
                    - dnf -y install httpd curl
                    - systemctl start httpd
                    - echo foo > /var/www/html/index.html
                    - curl http://localhost/ | grep foo
    /script:
        summary: Multi-line shell script
        description:
            Providing a multi-line shell script is also
            supported. In that case executor will store given
            script into a file and execute.
        example: |
            execute:
                script: |
                    dnf -y install httpd curl
                    systemctl start httpd
                    echo foo > /var/www/html/index.html
                    curl http://localhost/ | grep foo
