summary: Provision a system for testing

description: |
    Describes what environment is needed for testing and how it
    should be provisioned. There are several provision plugins
    supporting multiple ways to provision the environment for
    testing, for example
    :ref:`/spec/plans/provision/virtual`,
    :ref:`/spec/plans/provision/container`,
    :ref:`/spec/plans/provision/connect`,
    :ref:`/spec/plans/provision/local` or
    :ref:`/spec/plans/provision/artemis`.
    See individual plugin documentation for details about
    supported options.

    As part of the provision step it is also possible to specify
    detailed hardware requirements for the testing environment.
    See the :ref:`/spec/hardware` specification section for
    details.

    As part of the provision step it is also possible to specify
    kickstart file used during the installation.
    See the :ref:`/spec/plans/provision/kickstart` specification
    section for details.

    # Provision a local virtual machine with the latest Fedora
    provision:
        how: virtual
        image: fedora

/virtual:
    summary: Provision a virtual machine (default)
    description:
        Create a new virtual machine on the localhost using
        testcloud (libvirt). Testcloud takes care of downloading
        an image and making necessary changes to it for optimal
        experience (such as disabling UseDNS and GSSAPI for SSH).

    example:
      - |
        # Provision a fedora virtual machine
        provision:
            how: virtual
            image: fedora
      - |
        # Provision a virtual machine from a specific QCOW2 file,
        # using specific memory and disk settings, using the fedora user,
        # and using sudo to run scripts.
        provision:
            how: virtual

/local:
    summary: Use the localhost for testing
    description:
        Do not provision any system. Tests will be executed
        directly on the localhost. Note that for some actions like
        installing additional packages you need root permission or
        enabled sudo.

/multihost:
    summary: Multihost testing specification

    description: |
        .. versionchanged:: 1.24

        As a part of the provision step it is possible to request
        multiple guests to be provisioned for testing. Each guest
        has to be assigned a unique ``name`` which is used to
        identify it.

        The optional parameter ``role`` can be used to mark
        related guests so that common actions can be applied to
        all such guests at once. An example role name can be
        `client` or `server` but arbitrary identifier can be used.

        Both `name` and `role` can be used together with the
        ``where`` key to select guests on which the
        :ref:`preparation</spec/plans/prepare/where>`
        tasks should be applied or where the test
        :ref:`execution</spec/plans/discover/where>` should
        take place.

        See :ref:`/spec/plans/guest-topology` for details on how
        this information is exposed to tests and ``prepare`` and
        ``finish`` tasks.

    example: |
        # Request two guests
        provision:
          - name: server
            how: virtual
          - name: client
            how: virtual

        # Assign role to guests
        provision:
          - name: main-server
            role: primary
          - name: backup-one
            role: replica
          - name: backup-two
            role: replica
          - name: tester-one
            role: client
          - name: tester-two
            role: client
