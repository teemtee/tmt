/ansible:
    summary:
        Perform finishing tasks using ansible
    description: |
        One or more playbooks can be provided as a list under the
        ``playbook`` attribute.  Each of them will be applied
        using ``ansible-playbook`` in the given order. The path
        must be relative to the metadata tree root.

        Remote playbooks can be referenced as well as the local ones,
        and both kinds can be used at the same time.

    example: |
        finish:
            how: ansible
            playbook:
                - playbooks/common.yml
                - playbooks/os/rhel7.yml
