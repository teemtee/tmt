summary: Definition of the test execution context

story:
    As a user I want to define the default context in which tests
    included in given plan should be executed.

description: |
    Define the default context values for all tests executed under
    the given plan. This overrides context values auto-detected
    from the environment, such as ``distro``, ``variant`` or
    ``arch`` but can overriden by context provided directly on the
    command line. See the :ref:`/spec/context` definition for the
    full list of supported context dimensions.

    context:
        collection: httpd24

    summary:
