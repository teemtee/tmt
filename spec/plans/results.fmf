summary: Define format of on-disk storage of results
title: Results Format
order: 90

description: |
    The following text defines a YAML file structure tmt uses for storing
    results. tmt itself will use it when saving results of ``execute`` step,
    and custom test results are required to follow it when creating their
    ``results.yaml`` file.

    Tests may choose JSON instead of YAML for their custom results file and
    create ``results.json`` file, but tmt itself will always stick to YAML,
    the final results would be provided in ``results.yaml`` file in any case.

    Results are saved as a single list of dictionaries, each describing
    a single test result.

    .. code-block::

       # String, name of the test.
       name: /test/one

       # fmf ID of the test.
       fmf_id:
         url: http://some.git.host.com/project/tests.git
         name: /test/one
         path: /

       # String, outcome of the test execution.
       result: "pass"|"fail"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"skip"

       # String, optional comment to report with the result.
       note: "Things were great."

       # List of strings, paths to file logs.
       log:
         - path/to/log1
         - path/to/log1
           ...

       # Mapping, collection of various test IDs, if there are any to track.
       ids:
         some-id: foo
         another-id: bar

       # String, when the test started, in an ISO 8601 format.
       start-time: "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmmm+ZZ:ZZ"

       # String, when the test finished, in an ISO 8601 format.
       end-time: "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmmm+ZZ:ZZ"

       # String, how long did the test run.
       duration: hh:mm:ss

       # Integer, serial number of the test in the sequence of all tests of a plan.
       serial-number: 1

       # Mapping, describes the guest on which the test was executed.
       guest:
         name: client-1
         role: clients

       # String, path to /data directory storing possible test artifacts
       data-path: path/to/test/data

       # Mapping, stores the actual fmf context defined for this test.
       # It's a combination of the context provided via command line
       # and plan's `context` key.
       context:
         some-dimension:
           - its-value
         another-dimension:
           - first-value
           - second-value
             ...

      # Represents results of all test checks executed as driven by test's `check`
      # key. Fields have the same meaning as fields of the "parent" test result, but
      # relate to each check alone.
      check:
          # String, outcome of the test execution.
        - result: "pass"|"fail"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"skip"

          # String, optional comment to report with the result.
          note: "Things were great."

          # List of strings, paths to file logs.
          log:
            - path/to/check/log1
            - path/to/check/log1
              ...

          # String, when the check started, in an ISO 8601 format.
          start-time: "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmmm+ZZ:ZZ"

          # String, when the check finished, in an ISO 8601 format.
          end-time: "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmmm+ZZ:ZZ"

          # String, how long did the check run.
          duration: hh:mm:ss

          # String, name of the check. Corresponds to the name of the check
          # specified in test metadata.
          name: dummy

          # String, the place in test workflow when the check was executed.
          event: "before-test"|"after-test"

    The ``result`` key can have the following values:

    pass
        Test execution successfully finished and passed.

    info
        Test finished but only produced an informational
        message. Represents a soft pass, used for tests
        with the :ref:`/spec/tests/result` attribute set
        to ``info``. Automation must treat this as a
        passed test.

    warn
        A problem appeared during test execution which does
        not affect test results but might be worth checking
        and fixing. For example test cleanup phase failed.
        Automation must treat this as a failed test.

    error
        Undefined problem encountered during test execution.
        Human inspection is needed to investigate whether it
        was a test bug, infrastructure error or a real test
        failure. Automation must treat it as a failed test.

    fail
        Test execution successfully finished and failed.

    skip
        Test was discovered but not executed. Can be used when
        a single process produces multiple results but not all
        tests were run.

    The ``name`` and ``result`` keys are required. Also, ``name``, ``result``,
    and ``event`` keys are required for entries under ``check`` key. Custom
    result files may omit all other keys, although tmt plugins will strive to
    provide as many keys as possible.

    When importing the :ref:`custom results file </spec/tests/result>`, each
    test name referenced in the file by the ``name`` key would be prefixed by
    the original test name. A special case, ``name: /``, sets the result for
    the original test itself.

    The ``log`` key must list **relative** paths. Paths in the custom
    results file are treated as relative to ``${TMT_TEST_DATA}`` path.
    Paths in the final results file, saved by the execute step, will be
    relative to the location of the results file itself.

    The first ``log`` item is considered to be the "main" log, presented
    to the user by default.

    The ``serial-number``, ``guest`` and ``fmf_id`` keys, if present in the
    custom results file, will be overwritten by tmt during their import after
    test completes. This happens on purpose, to assure this vital
    information is correct.

    Similarly, the ``duration``, ``start-time`` and ``end-time`` keys, if
    present in the special custom result, representing the original test
    itself - ``name: /`` -, will be overwritten by tmt with actual
    observed values. This also happens on purpose: while tmt cannot
    tell how long it took to produce various custom results, it is still
    able to report the duration of the whole test.

    The same applies to ``context``, tmt will set this key for the
    original test result in the custom result set to the value known
    to tmt.

    See also the complete `JSON schema`__.

    For custom results files in JSON format, the same rules and schema
    apply.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.30
       fmf context is now saved within results, in the ``context`` key.
