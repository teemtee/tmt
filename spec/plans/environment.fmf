summary: Environment variables

description: >
  Specifies environment variables available in all steps.
  Plugins need to include these environment variables while
  running commands or other programs. These environment
  variables override test :ref:`/spec/tests/environment` if
  present. Command line option ``--environment`` can be used to
  override environment variables defined in both tests and plan.
  Use the :ref:`/spec/plans/environment-file` key to load
  variables from files. The ``environment+`` notation can be
  used to extend environment defined in the parent plan, see
  also the :ref:`inherit-plans` section for more examples.
example:
  - |
    # Environment variables defined in a plan
    environment:
        KOJI_TASK_ID: 42890031
        RELEASE: f33
    execute:
        script: echo "Testing $KOJI_TASK_ID on release $RELEASE"

  - |
    # Share common variables across plans using inheritance
    /plans:
        environment:
            COMMON: This is a common variable content

        /mini:
            environment+:
                VARIANT: mini
        /full:
            environment+:
                VARIANT: full
  - |
    # Variables from the command line
    tmt run --environment X=1 --environment Y=2
    tmt run --environment "X=1 Y=2"

  - |
    # Make sure to quote properly values which include spaces
    tmt run --environment "BUGS='123 456 789'"
