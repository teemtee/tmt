/display:
    summary: Show results in the terminal window
    story:
        As a tester I want to see test results in the plain text
        form in my shell session.

        tool output directly in the terminal. Allows to select the
        desired level of verbosity
    example: |
        tmt run -l report        # overall summary only
        tmt run -l report -v     # individual test results
        tmt run -l report -vv    # show full paths to logs
        tmt run -l report -vvv   # provide complete test output

    description:
        Create a local ``html`` file with test results arranged in
        a table. Optionally open the page in the default browser.

    description:
        Prepare a JUnit report with test results, zip it and send
        it to a ReportPortal instance.
    example:
      - |
        # Set environment variables with the server url and token
        export TMT_REPORT_REPORTPORTAL_URL=...

        Save the report into a ``report.yaml`` file with the
        following format::

            result: OVERALL_RESULT
            plans:
                /plan/one:
                    result: PLAN_RESULT
                    tests:
                        /test/one:
                            result: TEST_RESULT
                            log:
                              - LOG_PATH

                        /test/two:
                            result: TEST_RESULT
                            log:
                                - LOG_PATH
                                - LOG_PATH
                                - LOG_PATH
                /plan/two:
                    result: PLAN_RESULT
                        /test/one:
                            result: TEST_RESULT
                            log:
                              - LOG_PATH

        Where ``OVERALL_RESULT`` is the overall result of all plan
        results. It is counted the same way as ``PLAN_RESULT``.

        Where ``TEST_RESULT`` is the same as in `execute`_ step
        definition:

            * info - test finished and produced only information
              message
            * passed - test finished and passed
            * failed - test finished and failed
            * error - a problem encountered during test execution

        Note the priority  of test results is as written above,
        with ``info`` having the lowest priority and ``error`` has
        the highest. This is important for ``PLAN_RESULT``.

        Where ``PLAN_RESULT`` is the overall result or all test
        results for the plan run. It has the same values as
        ``TEST_RESULT``. Plan result is counted according to the
        priority of the test outcome values. For example:

            * if the test results are info, passed, passed - the
              plan result will be passed
            * if the test results are info, passed, failed - the
              plan result will be failed
            * if the test results are failed, error, passed - the
              plan result will be error

        Where ``LOG_PATH`` is the test log output path, relative
        to the execute step plan run directory. The ``log`` key
        will be a list of such paths, even if there is just a single
        log.
