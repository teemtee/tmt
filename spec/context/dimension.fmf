summary: Supported context dimensions

story:
    As a tester I want to clearly specify dimensions, such as
    'distro' or 'trigger', so that I can well describe the
    context in which a test is running.

    The following dimensions are reserved for storing dedicated
    information as described below:

    distro
        The operating system distribution on which the application
        runs (fedora, fedora-33, centos, centos-8, centos-8.4,
        centos-stream, centos-stream-9, rhel, rhel-8, rhel-8.4).

    variant
        The distribution variant (Client, Desktop, Server
        Workstation, Silverblue, CoreOS).

    arch
        The guest architecture (aarch64, armhfp, i386, ppc64,
        ppc64le, s390x, x86_64).

    component
        Name of the relevant component, should match the source
        package name (bash, php, httpd).

    collection
        The Red Hat Software Collection name (python27,
        rh-python34, rh-mariadb100, httpd24).

        (mariadb, mariadb:10.5, httpd, httpd:2.4, perl, perl:5.32,
        ruby, ruby:2.7).

    trigger
        The event which triggered testing, see the
        :ref:`/spec/context/trigger` section for the full list
        of supported values.

    context:
        distro: fedora-33
        variant: Workstation
