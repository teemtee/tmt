summary: Definition of the trigger dimension

story: >
  As a user I want to run a custom set of tests for
  different events which trigger the testing.

description: |
  Testing can be triggered by various events and a different set
  of tests is usually executed for each of them. The ``trigger``
  dimension supports the following values:

  commit
      Project source code has changed. This can be either a
      pull/merge request or a new commit pushed to a branch.

  build
      There has been a new package built in koji or brew and is
      available for testing.

  update
      A new bodhi update or errata advisory with one or more
      builds has been created or updated.

  compose
      There is a new compose ready for integration testing.

  This context dimension will usually be provided from the
  command line.

  summary: Full test coverage (takes three days)
  discover:
    how: fmf
  execute:
    how: tmt
  adjust:
    enabled: false
    when: trigger == code
