summary: Definition of the initiator dimension

story:
    As a user I want to run a custom set of tests based on the
    service, pipeline or tool which initiated the testing.

description: |
    Sometimes it is useful to choose a custom set of tests for
    particular automation service or when tests are run manually.
    The following values are defined:

    human
        Test execution was initiated manually by a human.

    packit
        For jobs initiated by the Packit service.

    fedora-ci
        Testing in the Fedora CI pipeline.
        To be implemented.

    centos-ci
        Testing in the CentOS CI pipeline.
        To be implemented.

    rhel-ci
        Testing in the RHEL CI pipeline.
        To be implemented.

    ewa
        Errata Workflow Automation jobs.
        To be implemented.

    konflux
        Application builder.
        To be implemented.

    Each service, pipeline or tool is responsible to set the value
    to its name. For manual testing ``--context initiator=human``
    is expected on the command line.

example: |
    # Enable the plan only when run manually
    summary: Tests requiring special environment
    discover:
        how: fmf
        filter: tag:special
    execute:
        how: tmt
    adjust:
        enabled: false
        when: initiator != human
