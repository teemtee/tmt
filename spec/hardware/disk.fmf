    .. code-block::

       # A list of dictionaries, each describing one disk storage.
       disk:
           # Number or string, the amount of storage requested.
           # Bytes are assumed when no unit is specified.

    The :ref:`/spec/plans/guest-topology` may include the following
    fields in its description of the actual guest hardware:

    .. code-block::

       # String, path to the block device representing this disk.
       block-device: "/dev/vda"

    .. versionchanged:: 1.32
       Added `driver` and `model-name` into specification.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.34
       Added ``block-device`` into specification.

    # Require a disk big enough for testing
    disk:

  - |
    # Require a disk with specified driver
    disk:
