    # Require a disk big enough for testing
    disk:
      - size: 500 GB

  - |
    # Require a disk with specified model
    disk:
      - model-name: 'PERC H310'

  - |
    # Require a disk with specified driver
    disk:
      - driver: mpt3sas

    # Multiple disks can be requested as well
    disk:
      - size: '>= 2 GB'
      - model-name: 'PERC H310'
      - driver: '~ sas.*'

  - |
    # Requested multiple disks with the requested properties
