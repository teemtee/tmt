    See e.g. https://virtual-dba.com/blog/sockets-cores-and-threads/ for the
    socket, core and thread distinction.

    See e.g. https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/WikiChip for information on family,
    model, stepping and corresponding names. ``/proc/cpuinfo`` and ``lscpu``
    are also useful resources.
