summary: Specify how test result should be interpreted

story:
    As a tester I want to regularly execute the test but
    temporarily ignore test result until more investigation is
    done and the test can be fixed properly.

description: |
    Even if a test fails it might makes sense to execute it to be
    able to manually review the results (ignore test result) or
    ensure the behaviour has not unexpectedly changed and the test
    is still failing (expected fail). The following values are
    supported:

    respect
        test result is respected (fails when test failed) - default value
    xfail
        expected fail (pass when test fails, fail when test passes)
    pass, info, warn, error, fail
        ignore the actual test result and always report provided
        value instead
    custom
        test needs to create it's own ``results.yaml`` file in the
        ``${TMT_TEST_DATA}`` directory. The ``results.yaml`` contains list of
        dictionaries. Each dictionary must contain at least a ``name`` key,
        whose value would be appended to the original test name (a special
        value ``name: "/"`` sets result for the test itself) and a ``result``
        key. Optional keys are ``log`` (a list of paths to log
        files, each path must be relative to path in ``$TMT_TEST_DATA``
        environment variable), ``duration`` (in HH:MM:SS format) and ``note``.

example:
  - |
    # Plain swapping fail to pass and pass to fail result
    result: xfail
  - |
    # Custom results - results.yaml needs to be provided to the ${TMT_TEST_DATA} directory
    result: custom
  - |
    # Example content of results.yaml
    - name: /test/passing
      result: pass
      log:
        - pass_log
      duration: 00:11:22
      note: good result
    - name: /test/failing
      result: fail
      log:
        - fail_log
        - another_log
      duration: 00:22:33
      note: fail result
    - name: /test/no_keys
      result: pass
