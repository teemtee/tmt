summary: Specify how test result should be interpreted

story:
    As a tester I want to regularly execute the test but
    temporarily ignore test result until more investigation is
    done and the test can be fixed properly.

description: |
    Even if a test fails it might makes sense to execute it to be
    able to manually review the results (ignore test result) or
    ensure the behaviour has not unexpectedly changed and the test
    is still failing (expected fail). The following values are
    supported:

    respect
        test result is respected (fails when test failed) - default value
    xfail
        expected fail (pass when test fails, fail when test passes)
    pass, info, warn, error, fail
        ignore the actual test result and always report provided
        value instead
    custom
        test needs to create its own ``results.yaml`` or
        ``results.json`` file in the ``${TMT_TEST_DATA}``
        directory. The format of the file, notes and detailed examples
        are documented at :ref:`/spec/plans/results`.

example:
  - |
    # Plain swapping fail to pass and pass to fail result
    result: xfail

  - |
    # Look for $TMT_TEST_DATA/results.yaml (or results.json) with custom results
    result: custom
