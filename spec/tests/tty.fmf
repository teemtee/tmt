summary: Test terminal environment

story:
    As a tester I want my test to have terminal environment
    available, because it needs it for successful execution.

description: |
    Attribute marks whether during execution of the test a
    terminal environment should be available. Terminal environment
    is provided by creating a pseudo-terminal and keeping it
    available for the executed test.

    .. warning::

        For the ``local`` provisioner no tty is allocated, and
        this attribute is therefore ignored. Please open a new
        issue to the project if you would like to get this fixed.

    It's value must be a ``boolean``. The default value is
    ``false``.

    .. versionadded:: 1.30

example: |
  test: script.sh
  tty: true
