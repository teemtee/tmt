summary:
    Test Case Relevancy rules used for filtering relevant test
    cases

story:
    As a tester I want to skip execution of a particular test case
    in given test environment.

description: |
    Sometimes a test case is only relevant for specific
    environment.  Test Case Relevancy allows to filter irrelevant
    test cases out.

    Environment is defined by one or more environment dimensions
    such as product, distro, collection, variant, arch, component.
    Relevancy consists of a set of rules of the form ``condition:
    decision``. The first matching rule wins. See the `Test Case
    Relevancy`__ definition for details about the concept.

    Should be a ``list`` of rules or a ``string`` with
    one rule per line.

example: |
    relevancy:
       - "distro < fedora-28: False"
       - "distro = rhel-7 & arch = ppc64: False"
    relevancy: |
       distro < fedora-28: False
       distro = rhel-7 & arch = ppc64: False
