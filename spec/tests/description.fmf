summary: Detailed description of what the test does

story:
    As a developer I review existing test coverage for my
    component and would like to get an overall idea what is
    covered without having to read the whole test code.

description:
    For complex tests it makes sense to provide more detailed
    description to better clarify what is covered by the test.
    This can be useful for test writer as well when reviewing a
    test written long time ago. Must be a ``string`` (multi line,
    plain text).

example: |
    description:
        This test checks all available wget options related to
        downloading files recursively. First a tree directory
        structure is created for testing. Then a file download
        is performed for different recursion depth specified by
        the "--level=depth" option.
