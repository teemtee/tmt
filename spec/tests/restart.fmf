summary: Handling test crashes

story: |
    As a tester I want to run tests that may trigger kernel panic or
    cripple their guest in other ways, often on purpose. I need a way to
    reliably continue with the testing process.

description: |
    Some tests may focus on lower levels of system functionality, and
    perform actions that cause system crashes. And the crashes might be
    triggered on purpose, e.g. to verify a system can recover.

    tmt on its own cannot detect a kernel panic, and cannot pick from
    all possible ways of handling such a situation, therefore offers
    tests a way to hint tmt on how to proceed:

    See :ref:`/plugins/test-checks/watchdog` for a test-level check that
    can detect frozen guests and trigger hard reboot before restarting
    the test.

    restart-on-exit-code: ``EXIT-CODES``
        When set, it lists test exit codes that should trigger the test
        restart. Environment variable ``TMT_TEST_RESTART_COUNT`` is incremented
        with every restart, which allows the test to skip parts of its code
        before/after restarts.


        Default: *not set*

    restart-max-count: ``LIMIT``
        How many times the test may be restarted before giving up. It
        must be at least 1, and the upper limit is 10.

        Default: ``1``

    restart-with-reboot: ``true|false``
        When set, a hard reboot would be triggered before restarting the
        test.

        Default: ``false``

        .. warning::

            Be aware that this feature may be limited depending on how
            the guest was provisioned. See
            :ref:`/plugins/provision/hard-reboot`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.33

example:
  - |
    # Enable test restart on specific exit code
    restart-on-exit-code: 255

    test: |
          echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic
          sync
          if [ "$TMT_TEST_RESTART_COUNT" == 0 ]; then
             echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
          fi
          echo "Test passed"

  - |
    # Enable test restart on exit code the test reports when detecting
    # kernel panic. Do not reboot the guest, the test needs to re-enter
    # the environment as it is.
    restart-on-exit-code: 255
    restart-with-reboot: true
