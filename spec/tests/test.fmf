summary: Shell command which executes the test

story:
    As a test writer I want to run a single test script in
    multiple ways (e.g. by providing different parameters).

description: |
    This attribute defines how the test is to be executed.
    Allows to parametrize a single test script and in this way
    create virtual test cases.

    If the test is :ref:`/spec/tests/manual`, it points to the
    document describing the manual test case steps in Markdown
    format with defined structure.

    Must be a ``string``. This is a **required** attribute.

    Shell options ``errexit`` and ``pipefail`` are applied by
    default using ``set -eo pipefail`` to avoid potential errors
    going unnoticed. You may revert this setting by explicitly
    using ``set +eo pipefail``. These options are not applied when
    ``beakerlib`` is used as the :ref:`/spec/tests/framework`.

example:
  - |
    # Run a script
    test: ./test.sh

  - |
    # Run a script with parameter
    test: ./test.sh --depth 1000

  - |
    # Execute selected tests using pytest
    test: pytest -k performance

  - |
    # Run test using a Makefile target
    test: make run

  - |
    # Define a manual test
    test: manual.md
    manual: true
