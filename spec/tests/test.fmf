summary: Shell command which executes the test

story:
    As a test writer I want to run a single test script in
    multiple ways (e.g. by providing different parameters).

description: |
    This attribute defines how the test is to be executed.
    Allows to parametrize a single test script and in this way
    create virtual test cases.

    If the test is :ref:`/spec/tests/manual`, it points to the
    document describing the manual test case steps in Markdown
    format with defined structure.

    Should be a ``string``. This is a **required** attribute.

    Shell options ``errexit`` and ``pipefail`` are applied
    by default to the shell script (using
    ``set -eo pipefail``) to avoid potential errors going
    unnoticed. You may however revert this setting explicitly
    in the attribute, e.g. using ``set +eo pipefail``.

example: |
    test: ./test.sh
    test: ./test.sh --depth 1000
    test: pytest -k performance
    test: make run

    test: manual.md
    manual: true
