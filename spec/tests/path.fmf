summary: Directory to be entered before executing the test

story:
    As a test writer I want to define the directory from which the
    test script should be executed.

description: |
    In order to have all files which are needed for testing
    prepared for execution and available on locations expected by
    the test script, automation changes the current working
    directory to the provided ``path`` before running the test.

    It must be a ``string`` containing path from the metadata
    :ref:`tree root<tree>` to the desired directory and must
    start with a slash. If path is not defined, the directory
    where the test metadata are stored is used as a default.

example: |
    path: /protocols/https
