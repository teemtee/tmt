summary: Packages required for the test execution

story:
    As a tester I want to specify packages which are required by
    the test and need to be installed on the system so that the
    test can be successfully executed.

    In order to execute the test, additional packages may need to
    be installed on the system. For example `gcc` and `make` are
    needed to compile tests written in C on the target machine. If
    the package cannot be installed test execution should result
    in an ``error``.

    For tests shared across multiple components or product
    versions where required packages have different names it is
    recommended to use the ``prepare`` step configuration (L2
    metadata) to specify required packages for each component or
    product version individually.

    Should be a ``string`` or a ``list of strings`` using package
    specification supported by ``dnf`` which takes care of the
    installation.

example: |
    require: make

    require: [gcc, make]

    require:
        - gcc
        - make
