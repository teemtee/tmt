summary: Packages, libraries or files required for test execution

story:
    As a tester I want to specify packages, libraries and files
    which are required by the test and need to be installed on or
    copied over to the system so that the test can be successfully
    executed.

description: |
    In order to execute the test, additional packages may need to
    be installed on the system. For example `gcc` and `make` are
    needed to compile tests written in C on the target machine. If
    the package cannot be installed test execution must result
    in an ``error``.

    For tests shared across multiple components or product
    versions where required packages have different names it is
    recommended to use the :ref:`/spec/plans/prepare` step
    configuration to specify required packages for each component
    or product version individually.

    When referencing beakerlib libraries it is possible to use
    both the backward-compatible syntax ``library(repo/lib)``
    which fetches libraries from the `default location`__ as well
    as provide a ``dictionary`` with a full `fmf identifier`__.
    For the latter case specify ``type: library``.

    When referencing local files or directories use ``type: file``
    and define list of paths relative to the fmf root directory.
    These can be regular expressions to match multiple files or
    directories or just a single file or directory name. By
    default everything under test :ref:`/spec/tests/path` is
    copied over to the system.

    By default, fetched repositories are stored in the discover
    step workdir under the ``libs`` directory. Use optional key
    ``destination`` to choose a different location.

    .. note::
       :name: nick-usage

       The name of the beakerlib library (the value used with
       ``rlImport``) is taken as the last directory pointed by
       ``url`` or ``path``. Use the ``nick`` key if you need
       to override this.

    For debugging beakerlib libraries it is useful to reference
    the development version directly from the local filesystem.
    Use the ``path`` key to specify a full path to the library.

    Must be a ``string`` or a ``list of strings`` using package
    specification supported by ``dnf`` which takes care of the
    installation or a ``dictionary`` if using fmf identifier to
    fetch dependent repositories.

    .. versionadded:: 1.65
       As a special handling when using ``type: library``, if both
       ``url`` and ``path`` is omitted, the current test's tree is
       used as the repo of the library. The ``nick`` key **must**
       be set in this case (see :ref:`previous note<nick-usage>`
       for what values to set for this)

example:
  - |
    # Require a single package
    require: make

  - |
    # Multiple packages
    require: [gcc, make]

  - |
    # Multiple packages on separate lines
    require:
      - gcc
      - make

  - |
    # Library from the default upstream location
    require: library(openssl/certgen)

  - |
    # Library from a custom remote git repository
    require:
      - type: library
        url: https://github.com/beakerlib/openssl
        name: /certgen

  - |
    # The following would take the `certgen` library from the top
    # level directory of the discovered `fmf` tree (the parent discover
    #  phase that imports the current test) and place it as
    # `libs/openssl/certgen` so that it could be imported using
    # `rlImport openssl/certgen`:
    require:
      - type: library
        name: /certgen
        nick: openssl

  - |
    # Library from the local filesystem
    require:
      - type: library
        path: /tmp/library/openssl
        name: /certgen

  - |
    # Use a custom git ref and nick for the library
    require:
      - type: library
        url: https://github.com/redhat-qe-security/certgen
        ref: devel
        nick: openssl
        name: /certgen

  - |
    # Require local files needed for the library or test
    require:
      - type: file
        pattern:
          - /include
          - /Library/common/helper.sh
          - /files/photos/IMG.*

  - |
    # Require whole fmf tree
    require:
      - type: file
        pattern: /
