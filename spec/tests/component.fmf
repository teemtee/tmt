summary: Relevant fedora/rhel source package names

story:
    As a SELinux tester testing the 'checkpolicy' component I want
    to run Tier 1 tests for all SELinux components plus all
    checkpolicy tests.

description:
    It's useful to be able to easily select all tests relevant for
    given component or package. As they do not always have to be
    stored in the same repository and because many tests cover
    multiple components a dedicated field is needed. Should be a
    ``string`` or a ``list of strings``. Component name usually
    corresponds to the source package name.

example: |
    component: libselinux

    component: [libselinux, checkpolicy]

    component:
        - libselinux
        - checkpolicy

implemented: /tmt/base
