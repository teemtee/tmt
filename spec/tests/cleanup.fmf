summary: Script to clean or recover system after test

story:
    As a tester I want to recover system after test or delete some files.

description:
    This feature equips testers with a customizable script to restore
    the system post-testing or perform file deletions. Testers can use
    this script across multiple TMT tests. This flexibility ensures
    effective system cleanup and recovery, streamlining the testing
    process. Must be a ``string`` or a ``list of strings``, providing
    a program names or script paths.

example:
  - |
    test: ./runtest.sh
    summary: "Test curl against "
    cleanup:
      - ./stop_server.sh

  - |
    /ngnix:
      summary+: ngnix
      cleanup+:
        - ./remove_users.sh
