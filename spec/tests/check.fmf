summary: Additional test checks

story:
    As a tester I want to employ additional checks before, during
    and after test execution. These checks would complement the
    actual test by monitoring various aspects and side-effects of
    the test execution.

description: |
    In some cases we want to run additional checks while running a
    test. A nice example is a check for unexpected SELinux AVCs
    produced during the test, this can point to additional issues
    the user can run into. Another useful checks would be kernel
    panic detection, core dump collection or collection of system
    logs.

    The following checks are currently available:

    dmesg
        check the kernel ring buffer and store its contents

        .. versionadded:: 1.28

    avc
        check for SELinux AVC denials, gather details about the
        ``selinux-policy`` related packages installed on the
        system

        .. versionadded:: 1.28

example:
  - |
    # Enable a single check, AVC denial detection.
    check: avc

  - |
    # Enable multiple checks, by listing their names. A list of names
    # is acceptable as well as a single name.
    check:
      - avc
      - dmesg

  - |
    # Enable multiple checks, one of them would be disabled temporarily.
    check:
      - avc
      - kernel-panic
      - name: test-inspector
        enable: false
