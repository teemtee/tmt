summary: Additional test checks

story:
    As a tester I want to employ additional checks before, during
    and after test execution. These checks would complement the
    actual test by monitoring various aspects and side-effects of
    the test execution.

description: |
    In some cases we want to run additional checks while running a
    test. A nice example is a check for unexpected SELinux AVCs
    produced during the test, this can point to additional issues
    the user can run into. Another useful checks would be kernel
    panic detection, core dump collection or collection of system
    logs.

    By default, the check results affect the overall test outcome.
    To change this behaviour, use the ``result`` key, which accepts
    the following values:

        respect
            The check result is respected and affects the overall
            test result. This is the default.

        xfail
            The check result is expected to fail (pass becomes
            fail and vice-versa).

        info
            The check result is treated as an informational
            message and does not affect the overall test result.

    .. warning::

        Note that running one check multiple times for the same
        test is not yet supported.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.38.0 the ``result`` key added

    See :ref:`/plugins/test-checks` for the list of available checks.

example:
  - |
    # Enable a single check, AVC denial detection.
    check: avc

  - |
    # Enable multiple checks, by listing their names. A list of names
    # is acceptable as well as a single name.
    check:
      - avc
      - dmesg

  - |
    # Enable multiple checks, one of them would be disabled temporarily.
    # Using `how` key to pick the check.
    check:
      - avc
      - kernel-panic
      - how: test-inspector
        enabled: false

  - |
    # Expect the AVC check to fail
    check:
      - how: avc
        result: xfail
      - how: dmesg
        result: respect

  - |
    # Treat the dmesg check as informational only
    check:
      - how: dmesg
        result: info
