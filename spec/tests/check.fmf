summary: Additional test checks

story:
    As a tester I want to employ additional checks before, during
    and after test execution. These checks would complement the
    actual test by monitoring various aspects and side-effects of
    the test execution.

description: |
    In some cases we want to run additional checks while running a
    test. A nice example is a check for unexpected SELinux AVCs
    produced during the test, this can point to additional issues
    the user can run into. Another useful checks would be kernel
    panic detection, core dump collection or collection of system
    logs.

    To control checks for a given test, use L1 ``check`` key.

example:
  - |
    # Enable a single check, AVC denial detection
    check: avc

  - |
    # Enable multiple checks
    check:
      - avc
      - kernel-panic

  - |
    # Enable multiple checks, one of them would be disabled temporarily
    check:
      - avc
      - kernel-panic
      - name: test-inspector
        enable: false
