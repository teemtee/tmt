summary: Maximum time for test execution

story: >
  As a test harness I need to know after how long time I should
  kill test if it is still running to prevent resource wasting.

description: >
  In order to prevent stuck tests consuming resources we define a
  maximum time for test execution. If the limit is exceeded the
  running test is killed by the test harness. Use the same
  format as the ``sleep`` command. Must be a ``string``. The
  default value is ``5m``.

example:
  - |
    # Three minutes
    duration: 3m

  - |
    # Two hours
    duration: 2h

  - |
    # One day
    duration: 1d

  - |
    # Combination & repetition of time suffixes (total 4h 2m 3s)
    duration: 1h 3h 2m 3

  - |
    # Use context adjust to extend duration for given arch
    duration: 5m
    adjust:
        duration+: 15m
        when: arch == aarch64
