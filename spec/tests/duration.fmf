summary: Maximum time for test execution

story:
    As a test harness I need to know after how long time I should
    kill test if it is still running to prevent resource wasting.

description:
    In order to prevent stuck tests consuming resources we define a
    maximum time for test execution. If the limit is exceeded the
    running test is killed by the test harness. Value extends the
    format of the ``sleep`` command by allowing multiplication (``*[float]``).
    First all time values are sum together and only after that are multiplied.
    Final value is then rounded up to whole number.

    Must be a ``string``. The default value is ``5m``

example:
  - |
    # Three minutes
    duration: 3m

  - |
    # Two hours
    duration: 2h

  - |
    # One day
    duration: 1d

  - |
    # Combination & repetition of time suffixes (total 4h 2m 3s)
    duration: 1h 3h 2m 3

  - |
    # Multiplication is evaluated last (total 24s: 2s * 3 * 4)
    duration: *3 2s *4

  - |
    # Use context adjust to extend duration for given arch
    duration: 5m
    adjust:
        duration+: 15m
        when: arch == aarch64

  - |
    # Use context adjust to scale duration for given arch
    duration: 5m
    adjust:
        duration+: *2
        when: arch == aarch64
        duration+: *0.9
        when: arch == s390x
