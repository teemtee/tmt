summary: Test maintainer contact

story:
    As a developer reviewing a complex test which failed I would
    like to contact the person who maintains the code and
    understands it well.

description:
    When there are several people collaborating on tests it's
    useful to have a way how find who is responsible for what.
    Must be a ``string`` or a ``list of strings`` (email address
    format with name and surname).

example:
  - |
    # Single contact
    contact: Name Surname <email@address.org>

  - |
    # Multiple contacts
    contact:
      - First Person <first@address.org>
      - Second Person <second@address.org>
