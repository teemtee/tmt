summary: Packages or libraries recommended for the test execution

story:
    As a tester I want to specify additional packages which should
    be installed on the system if available and no error should be
    reported if they cannot be installed.

description: |
    Sometimes there can be additional packages which are not
    strictly needed to run tests but can improve test execution in
    some way, for example provide better results presentation.

    Also package names can differ across product versions. Using
    this attribute it is possible to specify all possible package
    names and only those which are available will be installed.

    If possible, for the second use case it is recommended to
    specify such packages using the :ref:`/spec/plans/prepare`
    step configuration which is usually branched according to the
    version and thus can better ensure that the right packages are
    correctly installed as expected.

    Note that beakerlib libraries are supported by this attribute
    as well. See the :ref:`/spec/tests/require` attribute for more
    details about available reference options.

    Must be a ``string`` or a ``list of strings`` using package
    specification supported by ``dnf`` which takes care of the
    installation.

example:
  - |
    # Single package
    recommend: mariadb

  - |
    # Multiple packages
    recommend: [mariadb, mysql]

  - |
    # Multiple packages on separate lines
    recommend:
      - mariadb
      - mysql
