story:
    As a tester I want to store test metadata close to the test
    source code.

description: |
    Tests, or L1 metadata, define attributes which are closely
    related to individual test cases such :tmt:story:`/spec/tests/test`
    script, :tmt:story:`/spec/tests/framework`, directory
    :tmt:story:`/spec/tests/path` where the test should be executed,
    maximum test :tmt:story:`/spec/tests/duration` or packages required
    to run the test.

    In addition to the attributes defined here, tests also support
    common :tmt:story:`/spec/core` attributes which are shared across
    all metadata levels.

example: |
    summary: Check the man page
    test: man tmt | grep friendly
    require: grep
    duration: 1m
    tier: 1
    tag: docs
