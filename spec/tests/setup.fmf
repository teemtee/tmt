summary: Script to setup system before test

story:
    As a tester I want to start a service before test or create
    a temporary directory.

description:
    The parameter refers to a script that readies the system for testing
    by starting services or creating temporary directories. Testers can share
    and reuse setup scripts across tests. Must be a ``string`` or
    a ``list of strings``, providing a program names or script paths.


example:
  - |
    /apache:
      summary+: apache
      setup: ./setup_apache.sh

  - |
    /ngnix:
      summary+: ngnix
      setup:
        - ./setup_ngnix.sh
        - ./setup_usera.sh
