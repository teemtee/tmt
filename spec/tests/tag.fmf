summary: Free form tags for easy filtering

story:
    As a user I want to run only a subset of available tests.

description:
    Throughout the years, free-form tags proved to be useful for
    many, many scenarios. Primarily to provide an easy way how to
    select a subset of objects. Tags are case-sensitive. Using
    lowercase is recommended. Should be a ``string`` or a ``list
    of strings``. Tag name must not contain spaces or commas.

example: |
    tag: security

    tag: [security, fast]

    tag:
        - security
        - fast

implemented: /tmt/base
