summary: Free form tags for easy filtering

story:
    As a user I want to run only a subset of available tests.

description:
    Throughout the years, free-form tags proved to be useful for
    many, many scenarios. Primarily to provide an easy way how to
    select a subset of objects. Tags are case-sensitive. Using
    lowercase is recommended. Must be a ``string`` or a ``list
    of strings``. Tag name must not contain spaces or commas.

example:
  - |
    # Single tag
    tag: security

  - |
    # Multiple tags
    tag: [security, fast]

  - |
    # Multiple tags on separate lines
    tag:
      - security
      - fast
